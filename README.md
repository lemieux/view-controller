# ViewController

Under the pressure of the good folks at @supportkit, here's a quick README.

## Installation

Using npm: 
```
npm install view-controller
```

Using bower:
```
bower install view-controller
```


## Running tests
```
npm install
grunt test

## Documentation
The source code contains a lot of comments, but I plan to write a more comprehensive documentation.

## Contributions
I accept all form of contribution (a song, a drawing, or a cat picture will do)! I didn't put up a style guide yet, but since it's only one file, just go with it for now.
